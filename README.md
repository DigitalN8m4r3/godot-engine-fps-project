# godot-engine-fps-project

made with godot 3.0.6, should work with 3.1 but needs some adjustments like enabling collisions with areas for weapon raycasts

features:

 first person controller
 
 almost everything for ai is ready. it was never finished though
 
 dismemberment. the system is quite advanced, it isnt used at full potential.
 
 save system with quicksaves! probably could be improved
